This VisualDSP 5.0 project is configured to look in specific areas OUTSIDE 
of the CBPM-TSHARC directory tree for include files of various kinds.

NOTE: For proper updating of build ID information in generated executables (.ldr)
      files one MUST REBUILD all files in the project.  This is either due to a 
      quirk in how VDSP calculates dependencies, lag between changes to automatically
      updated header files gettnig propagated to disk in a timely fashion, or
      some other mechanism.  This is a workaround until the real cause can be
      investigated and corrected.   Again, for correct build information DO NOT
      just hit F7 to build the project.  Rebuild all files for all build attempts.


The areas that need to exist relative to the CBPM-TSHARC/dsp directory:

../../BeamInstSupport  (directory is parallel to CBPM-TSHARC)

../../acc_include      (needs to contain the utilities.h header file from 
                        a prebuilt ACC/CESR release.)

	Populate this acc_include directory with the following:
	Copy utilities.h from:
		/nfs/acc/libs/Linux_i686_intel/current/src/c_utils/include


	Copy CESR_platform.h from:
		/nfs/acc/libs/Linux_i686_intel/current/src/include/CESR_platform.h
        TO:   
                CBPM-TSHARC/include
